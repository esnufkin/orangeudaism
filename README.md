# orangeudaism
A open-source religion for the benefit of humanity through love, humour and scientific mentality

Origin
Orangeudaism was founded by prophet Dr. Usba on the 10th day of July 2017 in Elblag Poland, when they looked out of their cave, they saw Orange tree.  They immediately knew that they were holy. 
Our current KoolRabbi Brusda of Orangeudaism was chosen to serve as their leader and publicist because the founding of the religion coincided with the 14th anniversary of her menarche. She speaks to the the believers of Orangeudaism in English language with a slur of Yiddish accent. 
Believers of Orangeudaism are naturally drawn to the almightiness of  Orange and are touched by how Orange sacrificed themselves for our enjoyment. KoolRabbi Brusda wishes that curious and aesthetic human individuals could unite under the magic spell of Orange for their sweetness and juiciness.
Style

The religion is intended as a crowd-sourced religion that every member can contribute in a wiki style, i.e. everyone can practice and edit based on credible sources. However, there are a few conventions that we have established and we wish people to exercise if you are into joining the religion.
In order to express our appreciation towards Orange’s sacrifice and to absorb Orange’s loving grace directly into our head, we developed an advanced methodology to prepare our formal religious wear: Orange peel with healthy volatile oil glands that contain healthy polymethoxylated flavones into five equal-width strips joined at the pedicel. 
Hold the handle of a paring knife firmly in your dominant hand. 
With the tip of the knife, draw five lines from - the north pole (the pedicel) to the south pole (the navel) of Orange, just before you hit the flesh of Orange and make sure that it doesn’t break. 
Then clean up the Albedo slightly to make it comfortable staying in contact with your protein filament that grows from the dermis on your scalp. 
Wear it at important and official occasions of your life, e.g. when taking an ID photo. 


Values
We identify with many values of the human race, such as freedom, deep connection, genuinity, avidity, absurdity, curiosity, aesthetics, ..., and most importantly, love. We are united under millions of fragrant fruiting Orange trees on the surface of earth.
